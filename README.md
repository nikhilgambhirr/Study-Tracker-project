# Study-Tracker-project

-> Project Overview

The Marvellous Study Tracker App is a console-based Java application designed to help students systematically log, track, summarize, and export their study activities.

It allows users to maintain daily study records, view summaries grouped by date or subject, and export all logs into a CSV file for offline reference.

This project demonstrates practical usage of Java Collections, File I/O, and Object-Oriented Design in a real-world, utility-driven application:
